# IXTweaks

A lethal company mod pack that makes a variety of tweaks to the game... mainly to add support so that a majority of creatures drop samples or sample-like items
It also adds a few goofy changes and some scrap items cause it's my mod dammit, my rules.

# Hunter LGU Additions

Right now, the mod adds the following Hunter LGU drops to creatures:
+ Hygrodere : Lv. 4
+ Coilhead : Lv. 4
+ Nutcracker : Lv. 4

Note that just because a creature drops a sample, doesn't mean it's killable. For the hydrodere, for example, it will drop its sample when tamed and then attacked... though it won't be so happy with your betrayal. 
Though this mod DOES add killing functionality to some of the invincible monsters in the game. To be exact, the following are now killable in a gimicky way:
+ Coilhead : 3HP

In addition there are a few goofy scrap items that you can find as well:
+ Jeremiah the Slug
+ NyQuil
+ Windex

Stay tuned for more as I develop this mod :) (STILL HEAVY WIP)
